# PyPila Unit Tests
Unit tests practices in Python.

####unittests_functions_v1.py

This file contains seven simple methods that return correct result.  

####unittests_functions_v2.py
This file contains the same functions (like in v1), written in different way. Moreover (important!) - four of them return incorrect result.

####Task - step by step:
1. Implement unitests for functions unittests_functions__**v1**
2. Run unitests for unittests_functions__**v1**
3. If they passed - run them for unittests_functions__**v2**

Expected result: **4 errors**.
